## 🧑‍💻 Sample Project Showcase

### 🎮 **Mini Project: Number Guessing Game**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    srand(time(0));
    int number = rand() % 100 + 1, guess;
    cout << "Guess the number (1-100): ";
    do {
        cin >> guess;
        if (guess > number) cout << "Too high! Try again.\n";
        else if (guess < number) cout << "Too low! Try again.\n";
        else cout << "🎉 Correct! The number was " << number << endl;
    } while (guess != number);
    return 0;
}
```
